This was the talk for a graduate student seminar at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University. I used this opportunity to practice for my PhD preliminary examination.

I talked about our recent progress in discovering and utilizing spin defects in Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs). The Arxiv version of the related manuscript can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02709">here</a>.
