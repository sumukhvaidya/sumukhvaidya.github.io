I gave this talk for the Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) seminar at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University. These seminars help to disseminate recent results and get valuable feedback on research from the Physics community at Purdue.

I talked about our recent progress in discovering and utilizing spin defects in Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs). The Arxiv version of the related manuscript can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02709">here</a>.
