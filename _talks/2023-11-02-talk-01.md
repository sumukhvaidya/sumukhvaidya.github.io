This was the talk for my preliminary examination at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University. I have now officially become a PhD candidate!

I talked about our recent progress in discovering and utilizing spin defects in Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs). The Arxiv version of the related manuscript can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02709">here</a>.
