A list of things I've worked on over the years

* For my Ph.D. in Physics 
  * Advisor: Prof Tongcang Li, Purdue Physics and Purdue ECE
  * 
* For My Master's Thesis
  * Advisor: Prof Dinesh Kabra, Dept of Physics, IIT Bombay
  * Fabricated Large-Area, carbon-based Perovskite Solar Cells via screen printing methods. Obtained chemical handling training and Usage Authorisation on wet bench and glove box apparatus
  * Automated data acquisition for Time Delayed Collection Field Experiments using National Instruments VISA automation and control tools
  * Built a setup to perform Fourier plane imaging microscopy on samples of organic and perovskite thin films, to determine the emitter orientation in the films, enabling engineering of better devices
  * Simulated Fourier plane emission profiles of thin film emitters under laser excitation and successfully determined the emitter orientations in the films
  * Simulated in MATLAB the outcoupling efficiency and delayed emission profiles of LEDs based on molecular semiconductors to improve emission characteristics of devices via interfacial engineering
* During My Bachelor's

Work experience
======
* Dec '17: Visiting Student Researcher (<a href="https://wiki.kek.jp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=358613286"? Link</a>)
  * Noise reduction for Central Drift Chamber.
  * Advisor: Prof. Hiroyuki Noumi, RCNP, Osaka University, Japan
  * Implemented noise reduction measures in signal acquisition for cosmic ray tracking in drift chamber
  * Used c++ & Root scripts to visualise data & see channel response for detection of incoming particles
  * Characterised chamber response as function of gas flow rate & voltage to find best detection conditions
  * Calculated efficiency of the different detection channel layers in the Drift Chamber
  * Worked on c++ and Root scripts for tracking of individual particles to find real time trajectories

* May '17: Visiting Student Researcher (<a href="https://wiki.kek.jp/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=358613286"> Link</a>)
  * Advisor: Prof. Tsutomu Mibe, g-2/EDM Collaboration, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan
  * Received a letter of recommendation for applying to JPARC Asia Summer Student Program
  * Studied properties, output characteristics, effect of magnetic fields on Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)
  * Built a testing circuit testing PMTs as Muon Counters
  * Wrote a report detailing the experiment and findings regarding the effect of magnetic fields on PMTs
