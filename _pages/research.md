Over the years I have worked on a bunch of projects. 
Here's a list and a bit of information about them.

2023: Nanotube Spin Defects for Omnidirectional Quantum Sensing

<br>
Conventional quantum magnetometers (e.g. diamond NV, hBN $V_B^-$) have a preferential axis of maximum sensitivity, which limits their utility for sensing magnetic fields. 
We have discovered spin defects in Boron Nitride Nanotubes with omnidirectional sensitivity. We build on this by further developing a near-surface magnetic scanning microscope. 
We also invent a technique to reliably transfer a BNNT to an AFM tip, which turns the tip into a scanning quantum sensor. This can potentially be used to perform two-in-one magnetic map and surface profile measurements at the atomic scale.

<br>
We show a practical application of quantum sensing for real-world applications by using spin defects in Boron Nitride to detect small concentrations of paramagnetic ions in a liquid solution. We combine a microfluid cell with optical readout of the quantum sensors to interface the paramagnetic ions with the sensor. We show we can detect as few as $10^5$ ions in a small volume inside the focus of the laser. This has potential applications for building noninvasive all-optical sensors for ions in liquid solutions.

2022: Nuclear spin polarization and control in hexagonal boron nitride
------

The $V_B^-$ spin defect in hexagonal Boron Nitride is emerging as a prominent solid-state spin qubit system for quantum sensing applications. We demonstrate the polarization and control of the nitrogen nuclei surrounding the $V_B^-$ spin defect, and show that we can achieve 32% polarization under laser excitation in a magnetic field. This opens up new avenues for quantum sensing, communication and networks.
