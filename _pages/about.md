Hi!

I'm a fifth-year (as of July '25) PhD candidate at the Department of Physics at Purdue University, looking to graduate within the next year. I'm working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang/people">Prof Tongcang Li</a> as my advisor.

I'm currently looking for a job! I'm open to roles in optical engineering, optical sensors, display engineering, research scientist and so on. If you'd like to talk about any such opportunities, please reach out!

We explore novel physics phenomena in 2-D semiconductors such as hexagonal Boron Nitride from the perspective of quantum sensing.
I'm currently supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and have previously received support from DARPA and AFOSR grants. 

During the summer of 2024 I interned in the Display Hardware Engineering Team at Apple in Cupertino, CA.

I graduated with a B.Tech and M.Tech in Engineering Physics from IIT Bombay in Aug '20. I worked with <a href="http://home.phy.iitb.ac.in/~dkabra/">Prof Dinesh Kabra</a> as my Master's thesis advisor, where we explored charge carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors and perovskite solar cells. 

Feel free to explore the rest of my website, and do get in touch if you're interested in discussing something!
