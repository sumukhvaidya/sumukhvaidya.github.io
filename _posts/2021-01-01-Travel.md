I'll post some travel-related stuff here.

2024 December: A quick trip to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky after two of my friends passed their prelims. I've previosly seen the wonders above, this was a great time for the wonders below!

2024 November: I'm switching from a simple design of 1 waveguide per 2-in sapphire wafer to 28 per wafer. Twofold reasons:
  * My newer samples don't need as high MW power as before so I can make do with wirebonding.
  * I can make ~28 usables samples from 1 chip, which means I don't have to do fabrication as often
  * I save $$$s.

2024 Summer: I visited quite a few beautiful places in Northern California during my summer here. My favourite was Yosemite National Park. The whole place is made out of wallpaper material!

2023 October: Successful fabrication of some test wafers for my optical measurements. Yes, that is me in the reflection and I am wearing a clean room suit.
