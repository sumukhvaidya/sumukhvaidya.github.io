I'll post some travel-related stuff here.

2024 December: A quick trip to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky after two of my friends passed their prelims. I've previosly seen the wonder above, this was a great time for the wonders below!

2024 Summer: I visited quite a few beautiful places in Northern California during my summer here. My favourite was Yosemite National Park. The whole place is made out of wallpaper material!
