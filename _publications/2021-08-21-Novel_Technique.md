We demonstrate the tracking of excitons through the bulk of an organic semiconductor by developing a diffusion-based distribution profile and calculating the radial device emission profiles. This enables accurate tracking of charge carrier dynamics in an organic LED, leading to a better understanding of charge transport in OLEDs.
