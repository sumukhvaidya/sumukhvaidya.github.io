I taught the recitation section of the undergraduate introductory course in Modern Mechanics (PHYS 172) for the spring semester. Textbook used: Chabay and Sherwood, Matter & Interactions. I was working with <a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/rebellos.php">Prof Sanjay Rebello </a>.

I taught students to solve mechanics problems by drawing free-body diagrams and analyzing the resultant forces and accelerations. I also checked and graded their submissions.
