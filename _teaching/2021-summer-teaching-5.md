As a Teaching Assistant, I taught the recitation section of the undergraduate introductory course in Modern Mechanics (PHYS 172) for the summer semester 2021. Textbook used: Chabay and Sherwood, Matter & Interactions. I was working with <a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/rebellos.php">Prof Sanjay Rebello </a> as the Course Instructor.

I taught students to solve mechanics problems by drawing free-body diagrams and analyzing the resultant forces and accelerations. In addition, I Performed physics experiments for the online lab by using IOLab equipment and sharing data with the students. I also checked and graded their submissions.
